# PyEvolve - important notes that summarize what it does and how

## Workflow

!['PyEvolve workflow'](/PyEvolve/workflow.jpg)

## Motivation - why is the tool exceptional

- introduces a new “Transformation by Example” technique
- "data- and control-flow aware"
  - so if the same thing is implemented differently, it recognises it, and it can adapt the transformation rule(?)
  - semantically-equivalent but syntactically-different
  - ex:
!['table'](/docs/notes/infer_rule_table.PNG)

## How does it do it? - workflow breakdown

- TODO
